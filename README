This simple program converts non-deterministic finite automaton to
deterministic finite automaton using algorithm 2.25 from [1]. Input
and default output description of automaton is that used in automatons'
descriptions in test/ directory. 

Automaton's description can also be output in either form of directed
graph description in .dot format (GraphViz package) or in VCG
format. Automaton's decriptions in these formats can be consequently
visualized with appropriate tools.
